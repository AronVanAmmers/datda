        "selftext": "Where do I start with this guy? First, a bit of a background. Kelly Oubre came in with extremely high expectations out of high school, as the #8 ranked prospect of the class of 2014 (ranked #6 by Rivals.com, #7 by Scout.com, and #11 on by ESPN) and was ranked as high as 4th on the DraftExpress big board before the beginning of the college season. Oubre didn't exactly transition to the college game smoothly, and found himself struggling to crack Bill Self's rotation at Kansas to begin the season. His [early season struggles]( http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kelly-oubre-1/gamelog/) were worrying, with strings of games where he was rendered mostly invisible. It took him ten games to break double-digits in scoring (and that game was one of the highlights of his season, for sure, a double-double against eventual 16-seed Lafayette where he had 23 points and 10 rebounds.) As the year went on, he started to find his groove and finished the season with respectable averages of 9.3 ppg, 5.0 rpg (1.1 offensive), on 44.4% from the field, 35.8% from 3 and 71.7% from the FT line in 21.0 minutes per game.\n\nHis early struggles to break Bill Self's rotation were mainly due to his struggle to adjust to the system installed at Kansas and his inconsistency on defense, which [DraftExpress](http://www.draftexpress.com/article/Top-NBA-Prospects-in-the-Big-12-Part-1-Kelly-Oubre-Scouting-Video-4704/) had already previously noted about Oubre coming out of high school. He has the potential to be a great wing defender, but his effort isn't always there.  At 6'7\" with a 7'1.5\" wingspan, he's got excellent size and length and looks like a prototypical NBA 3. His frame is actually pretty similar to Andrew Wiggins', whom he has a one-and-a-half inch wingspan advantage over (Wiggins is an inch taller, however.) His closest comps when it comes to his frame? Based on the [DraftExpress measurements database](http://www.draftexpress.com/nba-pre-draft-measurements/) (which is an absolute drag to read, given that it has hundreds and hundreds of prospects from over the last twenty years or so, I mean, Shawn fucking Bradley is in the database), one is our very own Jerami Grant, who measured in at 6'7\" in shoes and a 7'2.5\" wingspan at 217 pounds. Another, coincidentally enough, is another current Sixer, Robert Covington, who measured in at 6'7.5\" in shoes and a 7'1.75\" wingspan at 209 pounds. The guy I initially thought had the most comparable measurables to Oubre, Kawhi Leonard, measured in at 6'7\" in shoes and a 7'3\" wingspan at 228 pounds, a tad bulkier and lengthier than Oubre. There's also Rudy Gay, who measured in at 6'8\" in shoes and a 7'3\" wingspan at 222 pounds. None of the comps I managed to list are as lanky as Oubre, who DraftExpress lists at 199 pounds. If you find one on the big database that you want to note, feel free to do so in the comments, I wanna see if I missed someone. While, again, the issue of his inconsistent effort on D is there, Oubre's size, length and fluidity allows him to pretty much keep up and contain just about any backcourt player thrown at him, something that he should be able to sustain in the NBA. Adjusting for pace, [he averaged 2.1 steals per 40,](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Kelly-Oubre-70215/stats/) which reflects his innate ability to play the passing lanes. His ability to crash the boards is notable for a wing, averaging an impressive 9.2 rebounds per 40 pace adjusted, 2.1 offensive. (Also in above link.) He is not a freak athlete like, say, his predecessor at Kansas, Andrew Wiggins, but what he is, is a very smooth and fluid player. He fills up the lanes in transition and can finish above the rim with ease, even though he isn't quite as explosive as a Wiggins or Victor Oladipo. Like I said earlier, he's pretty lanky, weighing around 195 to 205 pounds, but he can still stand to add around fifteen to twenty pounds on that frame, which should help immensely in the NBA, where wings are stronger and heavier.\nHis most NBA-ready skill is his outside shooting, for sure. He's got a smoooooooooth release which reminds me of James Harden (mostly thanks to his left-handedness.) The biggest reason his percentage looks \"meh\" from a first glance at around 36% is because of his shot selection, which wasn't quite the best at times. DraftExpress has referred to him as \"streaky\" ever since he came out of HS, but when he gets hot, he's pretty tough to stop.\nHis ability to create his own shot leaves a lot to be desired though. His handles aren't nearly as advanced as you'd like them to be, and he generally has only basic moves like a right-to-left crossover [as seen here in this highlight video at about the 1:30 mark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC3VXSPdWtw) If you're wondering why I didn't just jump to the 1:30 mark, it's because I advise you to take a look at the entire highlight reel. You'll notice most of his highlights consist of him being the ballhandler in transition and hitting outside jumpers in half-court situations (mixed in with a few defensive highlights like him picking the guy's pocket at the 1:42 mark.) [DX notes that 23% of his offense was made up of the former,](http://www.draftexpress.com/article/Kelly-Oubre-NBA-Draft-Scouting-Report-and-Video-Breakdown-4850/) and he averaged around 1 PPP (points per possession) in transition. It's easy to see how limited he is as a ball-handler from that highlight vid, along with the two DraftExpress scouting reports on Oubre's game (one from when he was a fresh recruit out of HS, one as an early entry prospect in this year's draft.) The biggest thing you'll notice is that he's very comfortable in catch-and-shoot situations, and he averages 1.071 PPP when shooting off the catch, 1.03 PPP in spot-up situations. There were a couple of clips in that first highlight vid of him shooting 3s as the trail man in transition, and he's comfortable stepping into those shots. He's still fairly inconsistent when shooting off the dribble, but you'll also notice a couple of clips of him taking a couple of dribbles before pulling up for (and, obviously, sinking) a jumper, which shows an area where he can potentially be effective in the future. In limited possessions, he's also shown that he can slash to the hoop with some level of consistency. DX notes that he averaged 1.06 PPP in 18 isolation possessions, and he certainly looks the part, showcasing the ability to take it to the rack, though his limited handle prevents him from getting into that second gear necessary to explode and beat the defender off the bounce.\n\nOubre is an extremely raw prospect at the moment, but his upside is tantalizing. That said, it's not a guarantee that he'll be able to tap into that well of potential he possesses. His game has its share of holes, from his shot-creation to his consistency, and he struggles to create shots for his teammates well, with a sub-par 8% assist percentage, which ranks dead last among wings in the DX top 100 big board. Nevertheless, he's an exciting prospect who should find himself drafted around the 8-13 range. If only we had that god damn Heat pick, we'd have a shot at him...god damn it. I can't really pin down a good comparison for him in the NBA, though he looks like he could be similar to the aforementioned Kawhi Leonard, though his jump shot certainly looks much better than Leonard's when he was coming out of SDSU. The comparison I've most often seen for Oubre is Rudy Gay. Oubre is currently slotted in at #12 on the DX mock, the fourth wing off the board behind Justise Winslow, Mario Hezonja and Stanley Johnson, and the general consensus on him is that he is a mid-to-late lottery pick in this year's draft.",
